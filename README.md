Recent Michigan weather has demonstrated the various hazards on the road due to high winds and snowstorms. In addition, road debris is hazardous and poses a potential to cause accidents. Per AAA traffic reports, there were 200,000 crashes from 2011-2014 caused by road debris. In our project, we trained, validated, and tested object detection algorithms to detect road debris in a given image, with the motivation of an improvement in autonomous driving. The goal was not the classification of the debris we would see in the images, but rather that a piece of road debris (focused on branches, litter, potholes, and traffic cones) would be identified in the first place.  In order to achieve this, we prepared a dataset of images that included debris and road class labels, trained and validated models with different CNN structures and hyperparameters, and compared test metrics of loss and accuracy.
